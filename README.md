**About Dataset**

  SeaDronesSee is a large-scale data set aimed at helping develop systems for Search and Rescue (SAR) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in maritime scenarios. Building highly complex autonomous UAV/drone systems that aid in SAR missions requires robust computer vision algorithms to detect and track objects or persons of interest. This data set provides three tracks: object detection, single-object tracking, and multi-object tracking.
